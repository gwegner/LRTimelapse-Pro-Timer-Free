- Added 1 sec decoupling to timelapse and single bulb shots. This allows the photographer to take the hands from the timer before the shooting starts.
You can configure the time in the sketch (const decouple time in line 37)

 -Intervals can now be a maximum of 999 secs (Over 16 Minutes) instead of 99 secs only.
 -Added acceleration when changing the intervals: intervals higher then 20secs will get increased/decreased by one second, intervals below this by 0.1.

- Introduces LCD backlight dimming for power saving and optical reason 
  long pressing select key steps dimming level. release key at suitable level
  when running: up down keys are increasing or decreasing brighness for your convenience
  consumption at available brightness leveles to get an idea of possible power savings:
  0 (OFF) 	 50 mA
  1 min		 55 mA  (you may now let backlight on always at this level)
  2		 70 mA
  3		 88 mA
  4		104 mA
  5		115 mA
  6		124 mA

- Params can be saved in EEPROM
  when backlight is turned on and pressing select key 2 times short and fast (double-pressing) these params are saved in EEPROM
  - actual display background brightness level
  - actual interval 
  After power on or reset these values are restored from EEPROM
  
- Turned OFF Onboard LED 13. it only consumes battery power.

Changes by Klaus Heiss, Austria (Thank you!)
- Introduces dynamic key repeating. This makes the keyboard more responsive.
  Key repetition starts with 2 per second and then increases to 10 keystrokes per second.
- changed Menu text for "No of shots" form "----" to "unlimited".  
- Made the key recognition less sensitive, so it will work without changes with a wider variety of displays.
- Added alternative key values into LCD_Keypad_Reader.cpp for a similar looking Display from Sainmart, but with other voltage steps. You may comment out this alternative values, if the key pressures are not properly recognized on your board.

- Added Left click Single Exposure screen. From the main (interval) screen press left, to reach the Single Exposure screen. Here you can either briefly trigger a single shot from the camera (press left) or you can use the up/down keys to set a bulb time.
Thanks to user Colin that brought up the idea in his fork on https://github.com/ColMol/LRTimelapse-Pro-Timer-Free/tree/master/LRTimelapse_Pro_Timer_Free)

- Added Shooting-Mode menu, M vs. Bulb
- New Bulb timelapse shooting mode for astro-photographers that would like to define the exposure time via the timer: in M-Mode, the trigger time by the timer will be the shortest possible for regular timelapse shooting, exposure will be set in the camera. In Bulb-Mode the exposure will be controlled and can be defined in the timer. The maximum possible exposure will be Interval - 0.5 secs dark time. This dark-time is defined as constant in the source code and can be changed, if necessary.
- Improved key responsiveness
