- Introduces LCD backlight dimming for power saving and optical reason 
  long pressing select key steps dimming level. release key at suitable level
  when running: up down keys are increasing or decreasing brighness for your convenience
  consumption at available brightness leveles to get an idea of possible power savings:
  0 (OFF) 	 50 mA
  1 min		 55 mA  (you may now let backlight on always at this level)
  2		 70 mA
  3		 88 mA
  4		104 mA
  5		115 mA
  6		124 mA

- Params can be saved in EEPROM
  when backlight is turned on and pressing select key 2 times short and fast (double-pressing) these params are saved in EEPROM
  - actual display background brightness level
  - actual interval 
  After power on or reset these values are restored from EEPROM
  
- Turned OFF Onboard LED 13. it only consumes battery power.

Changes by Klaus Heiss, Austria (Thank you!)
- Introduces dynamic key repeating. This makes the keyboard more responsive.
  Key repetition starts with 2 per second and then increases to 10 keystrokes per second.
- changed Menu text for "No of shots" form "----" to "unlimited".  
- Made the key recognition less sensitive, so it will work without changes with a wider variety of displays.
- Added alternative key values into LCD_Keypad_Reader.cpp for a similar looking Display from Sainmart, but with other voltage steps. You may comment out this alternative values, if the key pressures are not properly recognized on your board.

- Added Left click Single Exposure screen. From the main (interval) screen press left, to reach the Single Exposure screen. Here you can either briefly trigger a single shot from the camera (press left) or you can use the up/down keys to set a bulb time.
Thanks to user Colin that brought up the idea in his fork on https://github.com/ColMol/LRTimelapse-Pro-Timer-Free/tree/master/LRTimelapse_Pro_Timer_Free)

- Added Shooting-Mode menu, M vs. Bulb
- New Bulb timelapse shooting mode for astro-photographers that would like to define the exposure time via the timer: in M-Mode, the trigger time by the timer will be the shortest possible for regular timelapse shooting, exposure will be set in the camera. In Bulb-Mode the exposure will be controlled and can be defined in the timer. The maximum possible exposure will be Interval - 0.5 secs dark time. This dark-time is defined as constant in the source code and can be changed, if necessary.
- Improved key responsiveness
